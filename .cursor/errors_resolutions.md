# Errors and Resolutions

**Top Mistakes to Avoid:**

1. **Always maintain the correct return format in API response handling:** Ensure that the `promptForAction` function always returns an object with `content` and `role` properties, matching the expected `BetaMessageParam` type.

# Error # 2: Incorrect Return Format in promptForAction

**Error Description:**
The `promptForAction` function was inadvertently modified to return the raw API response instead of the expected `BetaMessageParam` format.

**Resolution:**
Restored the correct return statement in the `promptForAction` function:
```typescript
return { content: message.content, role: message.role };
```

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always double-check the return types and formats when modifying functions, especially those interfacing with external APIs.
- Maintain consistency with the defined types and interfaces throughout the codebase.
- When making changes, ensure that all parts of the function, including the return statement, are updated accordingly.
