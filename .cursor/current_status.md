# Current Status

## Iteration 1: Project Evaluation

1. Completed initial project structure analysis
2. Identified key components and their purposes:
   - Main process (`src/main/main.ts`)
   - Renderer process (`src/renderer/App.tsx`)
   - State management (`src/main/store/create.ts`)
   - AI agent logic (`src/main/store/runAgent.ts`)
3. Reviewed existing features:
   - Direct computer control by Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   - Real-time execution of AI-generated commands
   - Simple Electron-based user interface
   - Support for MacOS (with theoretical support for Windows and Linux)
   - Primary display interaction
   - Emergency stop functionality
4. Identified areas for enhancement as per the project plan:
   - Persistent settings
   - System prompt configuration
   - Enhanced logging with images
   - Plugin system
   - Window state persistence
   - Session management
   - Configurable tools system
5. Next steps:
   - Begin implementation of persistent settings
   - Set up development environment for new features
   - Create a more detailed roadmap for feature implementation

## Iteration 2: Persistent Settings Implementation

1. Installed `electron-store` library for efficient local storage
2. Created `src/main/settings.ts` to manage application settings
3. Modified `src/main/store/create.ts` to use persistent settings
4. Updated `src/renderer/App.tsx` to utilize persistent settings
5. Implemented saving and loading of `instructions` and `fullyAuto` settings
6. Next steps:
   - Test the persistent settings functionality
   - Move on to the next enhancement: System Prompt Configuration

## Iteration 3: System Prompt Configuration

1. Updated `src/main/store/types.ts` to include systemPrompt in AppState
2. Modified `src/main/settings.ts` to handle systemPrompt persistence
3. Updated `src/main/store/create.ts` to include systemPrompt in the store
4. Created new `src/renderer/SystemPrompt.tsx` component for editing system prompts
5. Updated `src/renderer/App.tsx` to include the SystemPrompt component as a tab
6. Implemented a resizable textarea for editing the system prompt
7. Added a "Apply Default Prompt" button to easily set a predefined system prompt
8. Modified `src/main/store/runAgent.ts` to incorporate systemPrompt in AI interactions
9. Tested the system prompt configuration functionality
10. Next steps:
    - Move on to the next enhancement: Enhanced Logging with Images

## Iteration 4: Error Logging Enhancement

1. Updated `src/main/store/runAgent.ts` to import and use `electron-log`
2. Modified `promptForAction` function to log errors from the API call
3. Enhanced `runAgent` function to provide more detailed error messages to the user
4. Implemented error logging for both API calls and general execution errors
5. Added logging of the message stack sent to the API when errors occur
6. Included logging of the full conversation history when errors happen in the main loop
7. Corrected an oversight in the `promptForAction` function to ensure the correct return format is maintained
8. Next steps:
   - Test the error logging functionality
   - Investigate and fix the issue with images remaining in the message history
   - Move on to the next enhancement: Enhanced Logging with Images

## Iteration 5: Enhanced Logging with Images

1. Updated `src/renderer/RunHistory.tsx` to display screenshots sent to the LLM API
2. Modified the component to handle both assistant messages and user messages containing images
3. Implemented image rendering using base64-encoded data
4. Ensured proper scrolling behavior for the run history
5. Tested the image display functionality
6. Next steps:
   - Test the enhanced logging with images feature
   - Move on to the next enhancement: Plugin System
